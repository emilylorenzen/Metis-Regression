Linear Regression Module - Minimal Viable Project

Emily Lorenzen

# Modeling the percent difference between sold and listed prices for recently sold homes in Portland, OR

To formulate a linear regression model, I used percent difference between sold and listed home prices as the target variable and the top 5 features which showed the largest absolute correlation with the target. These features were number of favorites on redfin, home square footage, price per square foot, the price per square footage, and walk score.
